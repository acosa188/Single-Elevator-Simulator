How to compile:

    javac Elevator.java

How to run:

    java Elevator <scheduling algorithm> <Idle policy>

Sample runs:

    java Elevator linear stay

    java Elevator linear bottom

    java Elevator fcfs stay

    java Elevator fcfs bottom

Debuging tools:
    Inside the main there are four debuging tools:

    debug  ------- when true, it lets the user see who's inside the elevator

    debug1 ------- when true, lets the user see the general queue(or who's waiting on each floor)

    debug2 ------- when true, lets the user see the stats for average response time for both up and down

Helpful tips on debugging:
    set
        debug  = true;              
        debug1 = true;
        debug2 = false;
    Debugging for current_time, knowing who's in the elevator, updating the general queue, and if the response time is generated correctly.

    set
        debug   = false;
        debug1  = false;
        debug2  = true;

    if the user only wants to see the average response times.

Important things to know about this program.
    This program
    - queues every arrivals times in floor 0 immediately. (user can change the arrival numbers by changing the global named NUM_ARR)
    - get same number of arrivals and departures (except for FCFS, I had bugs for duplications on departure? which I just throw it out because I didn't know how to fix it and so that it won't affect the stats).
    - generates departure after an arrival is serviced and puts it on the queue
    - relies heavily on updating its current time(simulated clock)
    - only service people below its current time.
    - only runs on a single elevator.
    

Note: There are some variables there that I didn't end up using, so just ignore it.
